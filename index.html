Local well-posedness for nonlinear Schr&#246dinger equations on compact product manifolds</i>

We prove new local well-posedness results for nonlinear Schr&#246dinger equations posed on a general product of spheres and tori, by the standard approach of multi-linear Strichartz estimates. To prove these estimates, we establish and utilize multi-linear bounds for the joint spectral projector associated to the Laplace&ndash;Beltrami operators on all the individual sphere factors of the product manifold. To treat the particular case of the cubic NLS on a product of two spheres at critical regularity, we prove a sharp $\small L^\infty_xL^p_t$ estimate of the solution to the linear Schr&#246dinger equation on the two-torus.

We establish global well-posedness for both the defocusing and
focusing complex-valued modified Korteweg–de Vries equations on the real line
in modulation spaces $\small M^{s,2}_p(\mathbb{R})$, for all $\small 1 \leq p <\infty$ and $\small 0 \leq  s < 3/2 − 1/p$. We will also show that such solutions admit global-in-time bounds in these spaces
and that equicontinuous sets of initial data lead to equicontinuous ensembles
of orbits. Indeed, such information forms a crucial part of our well-posedness
argument.

A fruitful approach to the study of concentration of Laplacian eigenfunctions on a compact manifold as the eigenvalue grows to infinity is to bound their restriction to submanifolds. In this paper we take this approach in the setting of a compact Lie group, and provide sharp restriction bounds of general Laplacian eigenfunctions as well as important special ones such as sums of matrix coefficients and in particular characters of irreducible representations of the group. We deal with two classes of submanifolds, namely,  maximal flats and all of their submanifolds, and the conjugation-invariant submanifolds. We prove conjecturally sharp asymptotic $L^p$ bounds of restriction of general Laplacian eigenfunctions to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds for all $\small p\geq 2$. 
We also prove sharp asymptotic $\small L^p$ bounds of restriction of characters to maximal tori and all of their submanifolds for all $\small p>0$ and to the conjugation-invariant submanifolds for all $\small p\geq 2$, and of general sums of matrix coefficients to maximal flats and all of their submanifolds for all $\small p\geq 2$. In the appendix we present similar results for products of compact rank-one symmetric spaces.

Denote by $\small SL_3(\mathbb R)$ the special linear group of degree 3 over the real numbers, $\small A$ the subgroup consisting of the diagonal matrices with positive entries. In this paper we study the algebraic and analytic properties of the invariant differential operators on the homogeneous space $\small SL_3(\mathbb R)/A$. Firstly, we specify the noncommutative algebra of invariant differential operators in terms of generators and their relations. Secondly, we describe the center of this algebra and prove that all of its symmetric elements are essentially self-adjoint. Thirdly, for the first time on homogeneous spaces, we identify several essentially self-adjoint invariant differential operators which do not lie in the center of the algebra of invariant differential operators.

In this article, we obtain new results for Fourier restriction type problems on compact Lie groups. We first provide a sharp form of $\small L^p$ estimates of irreducible characters in terms of their Laplace&ndash;Beltrami eigenvalue and as a consequence provide some sharp $\small L^p$ estimates of joint eigenfunctions for the ring of bi-invariant differential operators. Then we improve upon the previous range of exponent for scale-invariant Strichartz estimates for the Schr&#246dinger equation, and provide new $\small L^p$ bounds of Laplace&ndash;Beltrami eigenfunctions in terms of their eigenvalue similar to known bounds on tori. A key ingredient in our proof of these results is a barycentric-semiclassical subdivision of the Weyl alcove in a maximal torus. On each component of this subdivision we carry out the analysis of characters and exponential sums, and the circle method of Hardy&ndash;Littlewood and Kloosterman.

We prove Strichartz estimates for the Schr&#246dinger equation which are scale-invariant up to an $\small \varepsilon$-loss on products of odd-dimensional spheres. Namely, for any product of odd-dimensional spheres $\small M=\mathbb{S}^{d_1}\times\cdots\times\mathbb{S}^{d_r}$ (so that $\small M$ is of dimension $\small d=d_1+\cdots+d_r$ and rank $\small r$) equipped with rational metrics, the following Strichartz estimate 
$$\small 
\|e^{it\Delta}f\|_{L^p(I\times M)}\leq C_\varepsilon\|f\|_{H^{\frac{d}{2}-\frac{d+2}{p}+\varepsilon}(M)}
$$
holds for any $\small p\geq 2+\frac{8(s-1)}{sr}$,

We establish scale-invariant Strichartz estimates for the Schr&#246dinger flow on any
compact Lie group equipped with canonical metrics. The highlights of this paper include an estimate for some
Weyl type sums defined on rational lattices, the different decompositions of the Schr&#246dinger kernel determined by how close the points inside the maximal torus are to the cell walls, and an
application of the BGG&ndash;Demazure operators or Harish-Chandra's integral formula to the estimate of the
difference between characters.

This thesis studies scaling critical Strichartz estimates for the Schr&#246dinger flow on compact
symmetric spaces. A general scaling critical Strichartz estimate (with an $\small\varepsilon$-loss, respectively)
is given conditional on a conjectured dispersive estimate (with an $\small\varepsilon$-loss, respectively) on
general compact symmetric spaces. The dispersive estimate is then proved for the special
case of connected compact Lie groups. Slightly more generally, for products of connected
compact Lie groups and spheres of odd dimension, the dispersive estimate is proved with an
$\small\varepsilon$-loss.

"Time was when all the parts of the subject were dissevered, when algebra, geometry, and arithmetic either lived apart or kept up cold relations of acquaintance confined to occasional calls upon one another; but that is now at an end; they are drawn together and are constantly becoming more and more intimately related and connected by a thousand fresh ties, and we may confidently look forward to a time when they shall form but one body with one soul.",
    
"A mathematical argument is, after all, only organized common sense, and it is well that men of science should not always expound their work to the few behind a veil of technical language, but should from time to time explain to a larger public the reasoning which lies behind their mathematical notation.",

"My view is that mathematics is really very small, there aren't that many great ideas, and people use the same idea over and over again in different contexts.",

"It is clear from history, though, that it is best to use both analysis and algebra; insight comes from each.",
    
"Before Genesis, God gave the devil free reign to construct much of creation, but dealt with certain matters himself, including semisimple Lie groups.",
    
"I have often pondered over the roles of knowledge or experience, on the one hand, and imagination or intuition, on the other, in the process of discovery. I believe that there is a certain fundamental conflict between the two, and knowledge, by advocating caution, tends to inhibit the flight of imagination. Therefore, a certain naiveté, unburdened by conventional wisdom, can sometimes be a positive asset.",
    
"I have never let my schooling interfere with my education.",
    
"I think very very few schools in the world can even attempt or afford to cultivate children slowly with a necessary care... This has all been done because we have made making a living too big a thing.",
    
"The saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.",
    
"The study of mental objects with reproducible properties is called mathematics.",	  
	  
"If you learn to laugh at your own stupidity, all the rubbish in you will turn into manure very fast.", 
    
"But to you who are listening I say: Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you. Bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone slaps you on one cheek, turn to them the other also. If someone takes your coat, do not withhold your shirt from them. Give to everyone who asks you, and if anyone takes what belongs to you, do not demand it back. Do to others as you would have them do to you.", 
	  
"There is something sublime in the secrecy in which the really great deeds of the mathematician are done.",
    
"The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion that stands at the cradle of true art and true science.",
    
"If we do not do what we can do, we are a disaster.",	  
"I am opposed to textbooks... I find it hateful to give a course where I have to plough my way through chapter after chapter of a given book. The liveliness of the lecture, which is meant to give an impetus to the students, would suffer tremendously.",
    
"Stay mad, but behave like normal people.",
    
"Il xsemble que la perfection soit atteinte non quand il n'y a plus rien à ajouter, mais quand il n'y a plus rien à retrancher.",
    
"Once your physical body, your mind, your emotion and the fundamental life energies are all organized in one direction, anything that you wish happens without even lifting a little finger.", 
    
"An equation means nothing to me unless it expresses a thought of God.",    
    
"Fantastic!",
    
"Where there is an observer, separating himself from the thing he observes, there must be conflict. As long as I say, 'Anger is different from me, I must control anger, I must change anger, I must control my thought', in that there is division, therefore there is conflict. Conflict implies suppression, conformity, imitation, all that is involved in that. If you really see the beauty of this, then you can observe the totality of consciousness without analysis.",
    
"The most responsible way to live is that you are playful with life. Only when you are playful, you can pay attention to everything.",
    
"Until you make the unconscious conscious, it will direct your life, and you will call it fate.",
    
"If you move your life from reaction to conscious response, the quality and experience of your life will be entirely determined by you. This is enlightenment.",
    
"The more the universe seems comprehensible, the more it also seems pointless.",	
    
"Close some doors. Not because of pride, incapacity or arrogance, but simply because they no longer lead somewhere.",
    
"The best thing, the foremost thing and the most beautiful thing that you can offer to people around you is you are an evolved human being.",  
    
"For me, I am driven by two main philosophies: know more today about the world than I knew yesterday and lessen the suffering of others.",
    
"His [David Lynch] theory is that we don't all have to have the same understanding. Different things appeal to different people at different times, and it's not all logical and making perfect sense. But if it's real and true, it links up and you can connect.",
	  
"Like a wild animal, the truth is too powerful to remain caged.",	  
	  
"Liberty and love — these two I must have. For my love I'll sacrifice my life. For liberty I'll sacrifice my love.",
